# Brain-Tumor-Dashboard
## Project Objective 
To analyze 20,000 brain tumor patient records to identify patterns across demographics, tumor types, symptoms, imaging results, and treatments. The goal is to uncover risk indicators, support early diagnosis, and improve treatment planning through data-driven clinical insights.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/nisarga125/Brain-Tumor-Dashboard/blob/main/Brain%20tumor%20dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the gender distribution among brain tumor patients?
- Which age groups show the highest incidence of malignant tumors?
- What percentage of tumors are benign vs. malignant?
- Which tumor types show the strongest association with positive MRI results?
- How do MRI positive rates differ between benign and malignant tumors?
- Can MRI results reliably predict malignancy based on current data?
- What proportion of malignant patients receive radiation treatment compared to benign cases?
- How often is surgery required for malignant vs. benign tumors?
- What treatment patterns correlate with tumor type and patient demographics?
- How does family history correlate with the likelihood of malignant tumors?
- Which factors (age, gender, symptoms, family history) show the strongest link to malignancy?
- Do males or females have a higher incidence of malignant tumors?
- How does treatment vary by gender for each tumor type?
- Which variables best predict malignancy: MRI result, symptoms, age, gender, or family history?
- Are there identifiable clusters or patterns that can guide early diagnosis?
