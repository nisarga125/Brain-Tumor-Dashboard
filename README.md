# Brain-Tumor-Dashboard
## Project Objective 
To analyze 20,000 brain tumor patient records to identify patterns across demographics, tumor types, symptoms, imaging results, and treatments. The goal is to uncover risk indicators, support early diagnosis, and improve treatment planning through data-driven clinical insights.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/nisarga125/Brain-Tumor-Dashboard/blob/main/Brain%20tumor%20dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the gender distribution among brain tumor patients?
- Which age groups show the highest incidence of malignant tumors?
- What percentage of tumors are benign vs. malignant?
- Which tumor types show the strongest association with positive MRI results?
- How do MRI positive rates differ between benign and malignant tumors?
- Can MRI results reliably predict malignancy based on current data?
- What proportion of malignant patients receive radiation treatment compared to benign cases?
- How often is surgery required for malignant vs. benign tumors?
- What treatment patterns correlate with tumor type and patient demographics?
- How does family history correlate with the likelihood of malignant tumors?
- Which factors (age, gender, symptoms, family history) show the strongest link to malignancy?
- Do males or females have a higher incidence of malignant tumors?
- How does treatment vary by gender for each tumor type?
- Which variables best predict malignancy: MRI result, symptoms, age, gender, or family history?
- Are there identifiable clusters or patterns that can guide early diagnosis?

## Process
- Data Collection: Collected 20,000 patient records with demographics, tumor details, MRI results, treatments, and family history.
- Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, fixing categories, handling missing values, and creating derived fields.
- Data Segmentation: Organized data into groups based on gender, age, tumor type, symptoms, location, and treatment categories.
- EDA: Conducted exploratory analysis to identify distributions, correlations, and differences between benign and malignant tumors.
- Visualization: Built interactive dashboard visuals to highlight key patterns and comparative insights.
- Insights Extraction: Derived meaningful conclusions about risk factors, diagnostic indicators, and treatment trends.
- Reporting: Summarized findings and provided recommendations for early diagnosis and improved treatment planning.

## Project Insights
- Malignant and benign tumors are almost evenly distributed.
- Positive MRI results strongly correlate with malignant tumors.
- Family history significantly increases malignancy risk.
- Females show slightly higher malignant tumor rates.
- Malignant cases peak around ages 48–62.
- Malignant tumors receive more radiation and surgical treatment.
- MRI results and family history are key early indicators of malignancy.

## Final Conclusion
- The analysis reveals that MRI results and family history are the strongest indicators of malignant brain tumors, while demographics such as age and gender play a smaller role. Malignant cases consistently require more aggressive treatments like surgery and radiation. These insights can support earlier detection, improved diagnosis, and more targeted treatment planning.
